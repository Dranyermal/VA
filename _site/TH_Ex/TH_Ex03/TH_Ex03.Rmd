## Tasks

In this take-home exercise, we are required to apply appropriate data visualisation techniques to accomplish the task given below:

"Create a data visualisation showing average rating and proportion of cocoa percent (% chocolate) greater than or equal to 70% by top 15 company location. For the purpose of this task, *chocolate.csv* should be used."


## Data Preparation

### Installing and Launching R Packages

Before we get started, we will need to install the relevant R packages. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
packages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse', 'readxl', 'knitr','plotly','ggdist', 'distributional')

for(p in packages){library
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }

  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

### Importing Data

First, let us import the data into R by using the *read.csv* function. 

```{r}
chocdata <- read.csv("data/chocolate.csv")

```

Checking the data types of the columns in our dataframe shows that the *rating* column is in numeric format but the *cocoa_percent* column is in character format.

```{r}
str(chocdata)

```

### Cleaning Data

Before we proceed further, we will need to convert the *cocoa_percent* column to numeric format in order to perform further calculations on the data.

```{r}
chocdata <- chocdata %>%
  mutate(cocoa_percent = parse_number(cocoa_percent))

```  

Checking the data types of the columns once more, we can see that the *cocoa_percent* column have been converted to numeric format.

```{r}
str(chocdata)

```
<br>
<br>
Next, we will be preparing the data for rating and cocoa percent by company. First, a filter was applied on the *cocoa_percent* column to filter out cocoa percentages greater than or equal to 70%. Next, the dataset was grouped by company manufacturer for the rating and cocoa percent, and statistics such as the mean, count, standard deviation and standard error was calculated. 

Next, two separate dataframes were created, one for cocoa percent and one for ratings. 

Lastly, in order to have a more comprehensive analysis, all company manufacturers with only one rating was excluded from the analysis. To do so, the separate dataframes were filtered for number of ratings via the *n* column
<br>

```{r}
chocdata <- filter(chocdata,cocoa_percent>=70)

choccocoa <- chocdata %>%
  group_by(company_manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean = mean(cocoa_percent),
    sd = sd(cocoa_percent)
  ) %>%
  mutate(se = sd/sqrt(n-1))

chocrating <- chocdata %>%
  group_by(company_manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean = mean(rating),
    sd = sd(rating)
  ) %>%
  mutate(se = sd/sqrt(n-1))

choccocoa <- filter(choccocoa,n>1)
chocrating <- filter(chocrating,n>1)

```
<br>
Next, the dataframes were sorted in descending order by the mean values and the top 15 manufacturers were extracted.

```{r}
chocrating <- chocrating[order(-chocrating$mean),]
chocrating <- head(chocrating, 15)
choccocoa <- choccocoa[order(-choccocoa$mean),]
choccocoa <- head(choccocoa, 15)


```

## Data Visualisation

Finally, we employ *ggplot* and the *stat_halfeye()* function to show the uncertainty of point estimates for the rating and the cocoa percent for the top 15 manufacturers.

```{r}

ggplot(chocrating) +
  aes(y = company_manufacturer, xdist = dist_normal(mean,sd)) +
  stat_halfeye(
    aes(
      fill = stat(cut_cdf_qi(cdf),
                  labels = scales::percent_format())
      
    )) +

  scale_fill_brewer(direction = -1) +
  theme(text = element_text(size=15)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12)) +
  labs(
    fill = "Interval")+
  ggtitle("Difference in mean rating amongst top 15 Company Manufacturers")
```
```{r}

ggplot(choccocoa) +
  aes(y = company_manufacturer, xdist = dist_normal(mean,sd)) +
  stat_halfeye(
    aes(
      fill = stat(cut_cdf_qi(cdf),
                  labels = scales::percent_format())
    )
    
  ) +  
  
  scale_fill_brewer(direction = -1) +
  
  theme(text = element_text(size=15)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12)) +
  labs(
    fill = "Interval")+
  ggtitle("Difference in mean cocoa percent amongst top 15 Company Manufacturers")



```
